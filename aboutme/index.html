                    Hello! I’m Alec, a Game developer with 2+ years professional experience creating 2D and 3D web-based games within a team. Experience developing in a range of engines and languages, using version control, and collaborating with a team of artists, designers, and programmers to produce high-quality games. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June of 2021 amidst the pandemic. Some aspects of game development that I’ve really enjoyed diving further into are game systems, AI, procedural generation, and game graphics. I try my best to fill in wherever work is needed both within the code and outside of it. You can see some of my 2D and 3D art as well as design work, UI/UX, and sound assets where needed in my projects.
