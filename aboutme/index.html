I’m Alec, a game programmer with experience in a variety of engines and languages. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June of 2021 amidst the pandemic. Working in teams both in-person and remotely I’ve enjoyed planning out code structures, working with a producer to divide work in a way that plays to everyone’s strengths and interests, and hosting workshop sessions for teammates to get work done and receive help. Some aspects of game development that I’ve really enjoyed diving further into are game systems, AI, procedural generation, and game graphics. I try my best to fill in wherever work is needed both within the game programming and outside of it. You can see some of my 2D and 3D art as well as design work, UI/UX, and sound assets where needed in my projects.
