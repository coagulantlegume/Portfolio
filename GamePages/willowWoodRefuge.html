                <p><center>A 2D classic pixel art style platformer and exploration game where the player lives as a hermit in a dangerous forest, the player stumbles across a group of refugees escaping a mysterious magical attack on their home. Explore, forage, and cook to nurse them back to health.<center></p>
                <p><center>For this project, we used the MonoGame framework. MonoGame is a basic C# cross-platform framework implementing the XNA API. We chose this framework rather than an engine like Unity in order to learn by essentially building our own engine to best fit our game and learn along the way. With this in mind we created many of the libraries in this project from scratch rather than using pre-existing libraries. We used OpenGL in order to create builds for both Windows and MacOS.</p></center>
